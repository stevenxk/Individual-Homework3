Introduction:
In this analysis, I'm going to explore how fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (mpg), varies based on the number of engine cylinders and model year. We’ll also examine whether cars with fewer cylinders tend to be more fuel-efficient.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is the “Automobile.csv” file sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about car attributes such as mpg, cylinders, displacement, and origin.

This is a post with executable code.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Check the working directory
getwd()
automobile <- read.csv("Automobile.csv")
head(automobile)
```

```         
```

```{r}
# Summarize average mpg by number of cylinders
mpg_cylinders <- automobile %>%
  group_by(cylinders) %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the results
ggplot(mpg_cylinders, aes(x = as.factor(cylinders), y = avg_mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Fuel Efficiency by Cylinder Count",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Average MPG") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Plot mpg by model year
ggplot(automobile, aes(x = model_year, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "blue", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency Trends Over Model Years",
       x = "Model Year",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Findings

• Cars with fewer cylinders tend to have higher average mpg, reflecting better fuel efficiency.

• Fuel efficiency has improved over time, as seen in the increasing mpg trend across model years.
