Introduction:
This post examines how attributes like weight and horsepower differ by the car’s country of origin. We’ll explore whether cars from different regions have unique characteristics.

Dataset:
The dataset used is the “Automobile.csv” file sourced from Kaggle.

This is a post with executable code.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
automobile <- read.csv("Automobile copy.csv")
```

```{r}
# Boxplot of car weight by origin
ggplot(automobile, aes(x = origin, y = weight, fill = origin)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Car Weights by Origin",
       x = "Origin",
       y = "Weight") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Remove rows with NA values in horsepower
cleaned_automobile <- automobile %>%
  filter(!is.na(horsepower))

# Plot horsepower distribution by origin
ggplot(cleaned_automobile, aes(x = horsepower, fill = origin)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Horsepower Distribution by Origin",
    x = "Horsepower",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
sum(is.na(automobile$horsepower))

```

**Findings**

•	Cars from the USA are generally heavier than those from Europe and Japan.

•	Horsepower distribution varies significantly, with American cars tending to have higher horsepower.
