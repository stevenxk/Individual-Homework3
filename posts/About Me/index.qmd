## Hi, I’m Kye Xiong, a senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Information Science + Data Science. I’m passionate about data science and love using data to uncover insights. Outside of academics, I enjoy snowboarding, photography, and playing basketball. My projects include analyzing NBA jersey sales trends and creating user-friendly data visualizations. Through this blog, I aim to share my journey in data science, one dataset at a time!
